#  Experts Urge Renewable Energy Investors To Prepare For Roulette Game

The inevitability of government policy change creates a volatile investment landscape for renewable energy investors, an expert panel said at Infocast’s Renewable Energy Summit today.

“Renewables are now a mainstream part of the global energy mix but there is a lot of volatility because of the changing politics,” said Youcef Chelabi, director of Originated Transactions at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group.

He noted that while renewables represent 71 percent of new power generation capacity added in 2017, renewables investment has fallen by 23 percent since 2015.

“We have to be ready for a game of roulette – we don’t know where the policies are going to go next,” Chelabi said.

The sentiment was echoed by other panelists, who urged renewable energy investors to brace themselves for more uncertainty in the coming years.

“There is certainly risk in the market and it has increased over time,” said Kristian Andresen, partner and head of Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) North America at DNV GL, a technical advisor to the renewables industry. “Investors need to do their homework before investing in this space.”

Despite this volatility, however, renewable energy investment is still seen as a strong long-term bet. Global clean energy investment reached record levels in 2017, with $279.8 billion invested across all sectors – up 18 percent from 2016 and 60 percent above 2007 levels, according to UN Environment. The rise was driven largely by investment in solar and wind energy technologies, which accounted for 92 percent of total clean energy investment in 2017.

Renewables now account for almost a third of global power generation capacity, up from 17 percent in 2007, and are expected to provide 26 percent of global electricity by 2030, according to the IEA. Coal-fired power generation is forecast to peak within the next decade and begin declining thereafter; meanwhile renewables are on track to become the world’s No.1 source of electricity by 2040.

#  Swiss Energy Minister: We're Ready For Renewables Now

The Swiss Energy Minister, Doris Leuthard, has announced that the country is now ready to make the switch to renewables.

"We are convinced that the time for renewables has come," said Minister Leuthard. "This is a historic decision for our country."

Switzerland is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe, and it's also one of the most environmentally conscious. With this in mind, the Swiss government has decided that it's time to make the switch to renewables.

"The energy sector faces enormous challenges in the coming years," continued Minister Leuthard. "We must reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and switch to renewable energies."

Renewables will play a key role in Switzerland's future, and the country is already making strides towards this goal. In 2015, renewables accounted for more than 40% of Switzerland's electricity consumption. This number is only going to grow in the years ahead.

Switzerland isn't alone in its pursuit of renewable energy. Around the world, countries are making the shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. This is a pivotal moment for the global energy market, and renewables are poised to take over.

#  Banks Warn Against Renewable Energy Investments 

Banks are shying away from financing renewable energy projects, with the perceived higher-risk associated with renewables blamed for the hesitance.

In a new report, environmental campaign group BankTrack analysed 37 banks and found that just one-quarter of them support renewables to any significant degree.

The reluctance of banks to invest in renewables comes as global clean energy investment reached $373 billion last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

That’s down from the $483 billion invested in 2016, but still represents a healthy market. 

Nevertheless, big banks like JP Morgan Chase and ING are turning their back on renewables, instead preferring to invest in more traditional energy sources such as oil and gas. 

This is despite the fact that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the world. 

According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), by 2020 it will be cheaper to build new wind and solar plants than to keep running old coal and gas power stations. 

Renewables accounted for two-thirds of all net power capacity added globally last year, so it’s clear that the sector is growing rapidly. However, bank financing is essential if this growth is to continue. 

Banks have been burned before by renewables investments that haven’t panned out as expected. For example, the German solar company Sun Edison filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after racking up $11 billion in debt. 

But with renewable energy sources becoming more reliable and cost-effective all the time, banks would be wise to reconsider their stance on renewables financing – not only for the good of the environment, but also for their own bottom lines.

#  Renewables' Uncertain Future Could Spell Trouble For Swiss Economy 

Switzerland has a proud history of being a progressive, environmentally-conscious country. In recent years, the Swiss renewable energy sector has been booming, with wind, solar and hydro power becoming increasingly important sources of electricity. However, this growth may not be sustainable in the long term.

The biggest challenge facing renewables in Switzerland is the uncertain future of government support. The Swiss government has committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 50% by 2030, but it is not clear how this will be achieved, or what role renewables will play. In particular, there is concern that the government may scale back subsidies for renewables in order to reduce its budget deficit.

If subsidies are reduced, or even eliminated, it could be very difficult for renewables to compete with traditional sources of energy such as petrol and coal. This could have a negative impact on the Swiss economy as a whole, as the cost of renewable energy would become more expensive and businesses would be less likely to invest in renewable projects.

In addition to government support, another important factor for the success of renewables is public acceptance. Unfortunately, there is growing opposition to wind turbines and solar arrays in many parts of Switzerland. This opposition is often based on unfounded concerns about the health effects of renewables or their impact on the environment.

If public acceptance continues to decline, it could hamper the growth of renewables and make it harder for Switzerland to meet its emissions targets. Ultimately, the future of renewables in Switzerland is uncertain and depends on a number of factors beyond just technological feasibility or environmental sustainability.

#  Is The Future Of Renewables In Switzerland Uncertain?

Renewables are an important part of the Swiss energy mix, accounting for around 40% of the country’s electricity. However, there are concerns that the future of renewables in Switzerland is uncertain.

# What Are The Challenges Facing Renewables In Switzerland?

There are a number of challenges facing renewables in Switzerland. These include:

1. The high cost of renewable energy compared to traditional sources such as fossil fuels.
2. The lack of government support for renewables.
3. The reluctance of the Swiss population to embrace renewable energy technologies.
4. The aging infrastructure for renewables.
5. The need for greater investment in renewable energy technologies.
6. The impact of Brexit on the Swiss renewable energy industry.
