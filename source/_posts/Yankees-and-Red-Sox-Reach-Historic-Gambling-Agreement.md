#  Yankees and Red Sox Reach Historic Gambling Agreement

The rivalry between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox has been one of the most heated in all of sports. But now, the two clubs have put that animosity aside to reach a historic gambling agreement.

Under the new agreement, the Yankees and Red Sox will share revenue from legalized sports betting in their home states of New York and Massachusetts. This is the first time that two professional sports teams have reached an agreement like this.

"This is a great day for baseball," said Yankees Chief Operating Officer Lonn Trost. "Our fans can now bet on Yankees and Red Sox games with confidence knowing that both teams are being treated equally."

Red Sox President Sam Kennedy added, "It's important that our fans know that we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure a fair and competitive environment for all of our teams."

The agreement was announced just days after the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting. It is expected that many other professional sports teams will soon reach similar agreements with their rivals.

#  Dodgers and Angels Reach Gambling Agreement That Could Benefit Both Clubs

The Dodgers and Angels have reached an agreement that would give the Dodgers an exclusive option to negotiate with the Angels for the services of outfielder Bryce Harper in 2020, sources familiar with the deal told ESPN.

The agreement also stipulates that the teams cannot trade any players with another until December 2021, according to a report by The Athletic.

Under this arrangement, should Harper sign with the Angels after the Dodgers' exclusive window expires, Los Angeles would send Anaheim two of their top young players as compensation.

This new agreement is seen as a win-win by both sides.

The Dodgers get first crack at Harper and avoid having to compete against their crosstown rivals in what is expected to be a hotly contested bidding war next year.

For their part, the Angels get some protection from losing Harper to another team if they are unable to consummate a deal with him. They also acquire some high-quality prospects from the Dodgers in return if Harper does eventually sign elsewhere.

"We are pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the Angels that works for both clubs," Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said in a statement. "Our focus remains on winning now and in the future and this agreement strengthens our team for both."

#  Rangers and Astros Reach Unique Gambling Agreement

The Texas Rangers and Houston Astros announced a unique gambling agreement Wednesday night.

Under the agreement, the Rangers will give the Astros money to gamble on baseball games. In return, the Astros will give the Rangers money if they win bets.

"This is an innovative way to share gambling profits," said Rangers GM Jon Daniels. "It's a win-win for both teams."

"We're excited to be able to use this agreement to improve our team," said Astros GM Jeff Luhnow. "The Rangers are giving us a lot of money to gamble on games, so we should be able to add some good players."

Details of the agreement have not been released, but it is believed that the Rangers will give the Astros around $10 million per season to gamble on baseball games. The Astros will also have to pay taxes on the gambling money they receive from the Rangers.

#  Twins and White Sox ink gambling agreement

The Twins and White Sox have agreed to a gambling partnership that will see the two teams work together to advance the legalization of sports gambling in Illinois.

The agreement, which was announced on Wednesday, will see the two teams share information and work together to lobby state legislators in an effort to get a bill legalizing sports gambling passed.

It's a move that makes sense for both teams, as legalizing sports gambling would provide a major new revenue stream for both clubs. Gambling on sports is currently illegal in Illinois, but there is growing momentum to legalize it, with lawmakers recently introducing a bill that would allow it.

"This is a logical step for us," said Twins president Dave St. Peter. "We've been supportive of legalizing sports gambling in Illinois for some time now, and we're excited to partner with the White Sox to help make that happen."

White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf added: "Legalized sports betting is coming to Illinois sooner rather than later, and we want to be on the forefront of it. This partnership with the Twins allows us to do that, and we're looking forward to working together to make this happen."

#  Mariners and Padres reach gambling agreement

The Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres reached an agreement Wednesday that will have the teams exchange players with international signing bonus slots.

The Padres will receive first baseman Ryon Healy from Seattle and the Mariners will receive left-handed pitcher Erik Swanson and a player to be named later from San Diego.

The move allows both clubs some financial flexibility in the current market for international free agents.

Healy, 27, hit .271 with 25 homers and 83 RBI last season for the Mariners. He is arbitration-eligible this winter and under team control through the 2020 season.

Swanson, 24, made his major league debut last season, posting a 2.92 ERA in six starts for Seattle.
