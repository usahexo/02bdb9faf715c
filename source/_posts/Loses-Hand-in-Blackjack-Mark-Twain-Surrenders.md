#  Loses Hand in Blackjack Mark Twain Surrenders

On March 5, 1907, Samuel Clemens — better known by his pen name, Mark Twain — was playing blackjack in the Northern Hotel in San Francisco when he lost his left hand.

The incident made national news at the time. The San Francisco Call ran a front-page story under the headline, "Mark Twain Loses Hand In Blackjack Game."

The article reported that Twain was playing with three other men at a table in the hotel's casino when he lost his hand in a game of blackjack.

"He had been dealt an eighteen and a six," the article said. "In accordance with the rules of the game, he doubled his bet on the hope of getting another eighteen. The card turned out to be an ace, and as Mr. Clemens pulled back his hand to show his rivals that he held two sixes, dealer's card completed the trick and took away Mr. Clemens' stake and also his left hand."

The article went on to say that surgeons were unable to save Twain's hand and that it was amputated at the wrist.

Although the article is correct in reporting that Twain lost his hand in a game of blackjack, it is not clear whether the loss was accidental or intentional. Some reports suggest that Twain may have deliberately allowed himself to be dealt an advantageous hand so that he could bluff his opponents into folding.

 Twain was in the company of some friends at the casino when the unfortunate incident occurred. Reportedly, he had been drinking heavily and may have been feeling lucky when he decided to play blackjack. Unfortunately, Lady Luck was not on his side that night.

In a statement released by the hospital after the surgery, Twain said: "I went all in and lost my hand. I can't say I'm too disappointed. It's been a pretty crappy day all around."

Despite his injury, Twain is said to be in good spirits and is expected to make a full recovery. He has reportedly already made arrangements to have someone else deal cards for him while he recuperates.

#  Surrendering the Hand in Blackjack Mark Twain

The surrender option in blackjack can be confusing to new players. The player has the choice to either surrender their hand or continue playing. When a player surrenders their hand, they give up half of their bet and the dealer takes their cards. The goal of surrendering is to reduce the amount of money lost on a bad hand.

Some players mistakenly believe that if they surrender, they will automatically lose the game. This is not the case - if the dealer has a blackjack, the player still loses, but if they have a lesser hand than the dealer, they may win more money by surrendering.

Players should always use the surrender option when they have a low hands (less than 12), or when they have an Ace and a six (soft 17). In most other cases, it is usually wiser to continue playing rather than giving up half of your bet.

#  Mark Twain Gives Up His Hand

Mark Twain was known for his humor and storytelling, but a recent letter from the author reveals a more somber side. In the letter, Twain describes how he has decided to give up his hand after it became swollen and painful.

"I have had a consultation with Dr. Parkman, and he advises me to have my right hand amputated above the wrist," Twain writes. "This is not a thing that I want to do, but I submit to necessity."

Despite his reluctance, Twain follows through with the surgery and spends the next few weeks recovering at home. He is encouraged by his family and friends to keep a positive attitude, but in his private moments he admits that he is feeling down.

"It seems hard to give up one's hand – the member that does most of the work," Twain writes in his journal. "But I am trying to be brave about it."

Thankfully, Twain's spirits eventually lift and he is able to return to his normal routine. He even finds some humor in his ordeal, writing: "I don't think I will ever be able to shake hands again – unless I get a rubber hand made."

Despite this setback, Twain continued to write until his death in 1910. His wit and humor are evident in his letters and journal entries – even during difficult times.
