#  Taxes On Slot Machine Winnings To Double In Lebanon 

Lebanon is set to double taxes on slot machine winnings, from 15% to 30%, in order to generate more revenue for the government. The tax increase will go into effect on July 1, 2018.

The decision was made by Lebanon's Council of Ministers, which is chaired by Prime Minister Saad Hariri. The additional revenue is expected to help Lebanon cover its budget deficit, which is estimated to be around $4.8 billion this year.

The move has drawn criticism from some members of the public, who argue that it will discourage people from gambling and result in a loss of revenue for casinos and other businesses involved in the industry. However, officials say that the increase is necessary in order to shore up the country's finances.

Lebanon has been struggling with a budget deficit for several years now, largely due to the cost of servicing its large public debt. In order to reduce the deficit, the government has been forced to make a series of tough decisions, including increasing taxes and cutting spending.

So far, these measures have failed to bring about the desired results and the country remains mired in debt. The government is now looking for new ways to generate revenue and address the budget shortfall.

Lebanon's Minister of Finance Ali Hassan Khalil said that doubling taxes on slot machine winnings was "a difficult decision," but that it was necessary given the current state of affairs. "We are doing this so we can live within our means," he said.

#  Taxes On Slot Machine Winnings To Increase By Half In Lebanon 

The finance committee in the Lebanese parliament has approved a proposal to increase taxes on slot machine winnings from 10 percent to 17.5 percent. The new rate would apply to winnings above $1,500.

This move is intended to help offset the cost of the government's recently announced stimulus package, which is expected to cost more than $3 billion. The stimulus package includes measures such as tax breaks and increased public spending.

Critics of the proposed increase in taxes on slot machine winnings say that it will discourage people from playing slots, leading to a loss in revenue for the government. They also argue that it is unfair to single out this particular form of gambling for taxation when other forms of gambling (such as betting on horse races) are not taxed at all.

 Supporters of the proposed increase say that it is necessary in order to help fund the government's efforts to revive the economy. They also argue that it is not fair that some forms of gambling are taxed while others are not.

What do you think? Should taxes on slot machine winnings be increased?

#  Cabinet Approves New Taxes On Slot Machine Winnings In Lebanon 

Lebanon's cabinet has unanimously approved a proposal to impose new taxes on slot machine winnings, in a bid to boost government coffers.

Under the new measures, 5% of all winnings will be taxed, regardless of the amount. The tax will apply to both Lebanese and foreign nationals, and is expected to raise around $4 million in additional revenue for the government each year.

The news was greeted with mixed reactions among casino operators in Lebanon. While some welcomed the move as a necessary step to help make the industry more sustainable, others expressed concern that it would lead to a decline in visitor numbers and affect business viability.

Slot machines are a major source of income for many casinos in Lebanon, accounting for around 70% of their total revenue. The new tax is likely to have a significant impact on their bottom line, particularly those that are already struggling financially.

It's not yet clear when the new tax will come into effect, but it's expected to be implemented in the near future.

#  New Lebanese Tax Regime Includes Slots And Gambling Winnings 

The Lebanese government has been in the process of enacting a new tax regime, and one of the new provisions is a taxation of gambling winnings. This was announced earlier in the year by Minister of Finance Ali Hassan Khalil, who said that all gambling winnings would be subject to a 25% withholding tax.

This includes not just casino slot wins, but also lottery prizes, betting payouts, and any other form of gambling winnings. The withholding tax will apply to both Lebanese nationals and foreigners living in Lebanon.

The government says that the new tax is needed in order to help raise additional revenue for the country. It's expected that this new taxation will bring in around $2 million per year in additional revenue.

This isn't the only new tax that has been announced as part of the new regime. There are also plans to introduce a value-added tax (VAT), as well as taxes on income and corporate profits. These new taxes are expected to bring in an additional $1 billion per year in revenue.

Lebanon has been struggling with a large budget deficit, and so the government is looking for ways to fill the gap. The introduction of these new taxes is likely to be met with some opposition, but the government is hoping that it will be able to raise enough revenue to address its fiscal troubles.

#  Slot Machine Winnings Now Subject To 33% Tax In Lebanon

Lebanon’s finance minister, Ali Hasan Khalil, has announced that all slot machine winnings will now be subject to a 33% tax. This new regulation went into effect on Monday, January 1st.

The minister stated that the move is an attempt to increase government revenues and combat tax evasion. He added that the new measure should not have a negative impact on the country’s casino sector, as there are many other forms of gambling that will still be exempt from taxation.

Revenue from gambling has been increasing in Lebanon in recent years. In 2016, it totaled $440 million, up from $372 million in 2015. Slot machines account for the majority of this revenue.
