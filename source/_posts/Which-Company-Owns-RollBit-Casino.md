#  RollBit Casino: Who Owns It?

A quick internet search for "RollBit Casino" will reveal that this online casino is a newcomer to the industry. It was launched in mid-2018 and has been making a name for itself by offering great bonuses and promotions.

Despite its young age, RollBit Casino is already one of the most popular online casinos around. This is likely due to its fairness and security, as well as the wide range of games it offers.

When it comes to who owns RollBit Casino, the answer is a bit ambiguous. The casino's website does not list any information about the owners or operators. However, a review of the casino's licensing information reveals that it is licensed by the Curacao Gaming Authority.

This means that while RollBit Casino may be licensed by a reputable authority, there is no guarantee that the casino is actually operated by reputable individuals. In other words, it's always important to do your research before investing in an online casino, regardless of how reputable it may seem.

#  Who Owns RollBit Casino?

In June 2018, the founder of RollBit Casino, a Bitcoin-based online casino, announced that he was selling the platform. This came as a surprise to the community since the site had been operational for over two years and had built up a loyal user base.

The announcement created a lot of speculation about who would be buying RollBit Casino. Given the recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies by governments around the world, it was unclear whether any buyers would be interested in acquiring a casino that is based on Bitcoin.

Interestingly, there were no buyers forthcoming and as of October 2018, RollBit Casino is still up for sale. This has left the future of the site uncertain and its users anxious about what will happen to their money if the site shuts down.

# Who Is Behind RollBit Casino?

One question that has arisen in light of the sale announcement is who is behind RollBit Casino? The founder has not revealed any information about the ownership or management of the site. This has raised concerns among users who are worried about whether their money is safe with the current management.

# What Does The Future Hold For RollBit Casino?

It is still unclear what will happen to RollBit Casino in light of the sale announcement. The founder has said that he is open to offers from anyone who is interested in buying the site but there have been no serious bids as of yet.

If no buyer comes forward, it is likely that the site will shut down in the near future. This would leave users with nowhere to play their favorite casino games and could potentially lead to them losing their money.

#  RollBit Casino Ownership Unclear

Since the closure of the once popular RollBit Casino, the ownership of the website has been in question. It is still unknown who currently owns the website and its associated domain. Following its closure, there has been no statement from the casino's former operators or ownership. This has led to rampant speculation in the bitcoin casino community about what may have happened to the site and its players' funds.

Many people are concerned that the site may have simply shut down and run off with everyone's money. Others believe that there may have been a security breach which resulted in the loss of player funds. The lack of information from RollBit Casino only serves to fuel these rumours and speculations.

Some players are even calling for a boycott of any other bitcoin casinos until the owners of RollBit are revealed and held accountable for their actions. Only time will tell what actually happened to RollBit Casino and whether or not players will see their funds returned.

#  Which Firm Controls RollBit Casino

RollBit Casino has been in business for a few years and has become one of the most popular online casinos. The firm behind RollBit Casino is unknown, but some people are speculating that two companies are competing for control of the casino.

One company is a well-known casino operator that has been in the business for many years. The other company is a start-up that has developed some innovative technology that allows players to gamble with Bitcoin.

It is not clear which company currently controls RollBit Casino, but it is possible that both companies are vying for control. The competition between these companies could result in RollBit Casino becoming even more popular, or it could lead to the downfall of the casino.
