#  The Hidden Cost of Gambling Addiction

In any given year, around two percent of the American population suffers from a gambling addiction. For these people, gambling is not simply a recreational activity but rather a serious problem that can have devastating consequences.

Gambling addiction can have a number of negative consequences on both the individual and their loved ones. Financially, those with a gambling addiction can quickly find themselves in debt as they lose money betting on games or through other activities such as casino visits or online poker. Often, addicts will also gamble away important personal belongings such as cars or even homes.

Socially, individuals with a gambling addiction can become isolated from friends and family members as they spend more and more time at casinos or online gambling sites. This isolation can also lead to depression and other mental health problems. Physically, gambling addiction can cause health problems from bad decision making (e.g., eating unhealthy foods) to poor financial choices (e.g., spending too much money on drugs or alcohol).

Perhaps the most serious consequence of gambling addiction, however, is the potential for financial ruin. In 2013, for example, it was reported that one man lost nearly $200,000 in a single day while gambling in Atlantic City. Sadly, stories like this are all too common among those struggling with a gambling addiction.
