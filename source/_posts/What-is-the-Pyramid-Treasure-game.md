#  What is the Pyramid Treasure Cuba?

The Pyramid Treasure of Cuba is a hidden treasure that is said to be buried in the sand near the pyramid-shaped mountain at the Guanahani River in Cuba. The treasure is rumored to be worth billions of dollars and is said to have been buried by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century.

The legend of the pyramid treasure of Cuba began in 1511 when Spanish explorer Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar landed on Cuba and claimed the island for Spain. Velázquez was accompanied by a conquistador named Hernando Cortés, who was later famous for leading the Spanish conquest of Mexico. According to legend, Cortés discovered a large pyramid-shaped mountain near the Guanahani River and was told by the natives that it was the home of a god who protected a vast treasure.

Fearing that he would be unable to conquer Cuba if the god's treasure remained unclaimed, Cortés reportedly ordered his men to dig up the treasure and bury it again somewhere else on the island. The location of the treasure has been lost over time, but many people believe that it is still buried near the pyramid-shaped mountain at the Guanahani River in Cuba.

There is no concrete evidence to support the claim that there is any hidden treasure at all near the pyramid-shaped mountain at Guanahani River in Cuba. However, many people have searched for it over the years and there are several stories of people who claim to have found it. In addition, there are several old maps that show a pyramid-shaped mountain near Guanahani River and some historians believe that this could be a reference to the treasure itself.

#  How to play the Pyramid Treasure game?

If you're looking for a new and exciting game to play, Pyramid Treasure may be just the thing. This game is played on a board with three levels, each with nine squares. Players take turns choosing squares, hoping to reveal treasures while avoiding traps. The goal of the game is to find the treasure hidden in the pyramid and return safely to the ground.

To begin, choose one player to be the first Pharaoh. This player will choose one of the squares on the first level of the pyramid and place their piece there. The remaining players then take turns choosing squares on that level, moving their pieces accordingly. If a player picks a square with a trap, they are sent back to the beginning of the level. When all players have had a turn, the Pharaoh moves their piece to the next level of the pyramid.

The second level works in exactly the same way as the first, except that now players are also trying to avoid scorpions. If a player lands on a square with a scorpion, they are sent back to the beginning of the level. The Pharaoh also moves down to this level when it is their turn.

The third and final level is more dangerous still. The Pharaoh must now avoid snakes as well as traps and scorpions. If they land on a square with one of these hazards, they are sent back to the beginning of the level and lose one point. The first player to reach the treasure and make it safely back to ground wins!
