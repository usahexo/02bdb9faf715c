#  Maccabi Rishon LeZion Announces New Esports Division

Maccabi Rishon LeZion, an Israeli sports club, is the latest to join the esports fray by establishing a new division for the budding industry. The team will compete in several games, including League of Legends, Hearthstone, and Clash Royale.

“The establishment of an Esports Division is another step in our journey to create a more diverse and multi-dimensional club that will appeal to all members of our community,” said Deni Malenica, Chairman of Maccabi Rishon LeZion.

Maccabi joins a host of other clubs around the world that are making moves into the world of competitive gaming. Esports has seen rapid growth in recent years, with revenues reaching over $1 billion in 2019. This number is expected to grow significantly in the coming years as more and more people become interested in watching competitive gaming.

For Maccabi Rishon LeZion, the move into esports is about more than just making money. The team believes that competitive gaming can help promote teamwork and discipline among its players.

“Esports provides a unique opportunity for young people to develop their skills and teamwork while competing at a high level. We believe that our players have a lot to gain from this experience and we are excited to see them compete both domestically and internationally,” said Malenica.

Maccabi Rishon LeZion plans to compete in several international tournaments, including the European Champions League. The team is also partnering with several sponsors to help support its efforts in the industry.
