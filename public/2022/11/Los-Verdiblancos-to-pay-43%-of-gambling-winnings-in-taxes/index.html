        <h1 id="Los-Verdiblancos-to-pay-43-of-gambling-winnings-in-taxes"><a href="#Los-Verdiblancos-to-pay-43-of-gambling-winnings-in-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Los Verdiblancos to pay 43% of gambling winnings in taxes"></a>Los Verdiblancos to pay 43% of gambling winnings in taxes</h1><p>The Real Madrid football club will have to pay 43% of their gambling winnings in taxes, according to new legislation in Spain.</p>
<p>The new law, which came into effect at the beginning of this year, requires anyone who wins over 1,000 euros from gambling to pay tax on the winnings. This rule applies even if the winnings are not declared to the authorities.</p>
<p>As a result, Real Madrid is likely to have to pay a significant amount of money in taxes on their gambling winnings for the 2017&#x2F;2018 season. The club won the Champions League last year and is expected to make millions of euros from gambling this season.</p>
<p>The new legislation has caused controversy in Spain, with some arguing that it unfairly targets football clubs. However, officials argue that the law is necessary to ensure that gambling revenues are taxed fairly.</p>
<h1 id="Taxes-on-gambling-winnings-in-Real-Betis-highest-in-Liga-BBVA"><a href="#Taxes-on-gambling-winnings-in-Real-Betis-highest-in-Liga-BBVA" class="headerlink" title="Taxes on gambling winnings in Real Betis highest in Liga BBVA"></a>Taxes on gambling winnings in Real Betis highest in Liga BBVA</h1><p>The Spanish La Liga football club Real Betis has revealed that they have the highest taxes on gambling winnings in the Liga BBVA.</p>
<p>This was confirmed by the club’s Financial Director, Manuel Gimenez, who said that Betis pays 47% of all gambling winnings to the tax office. This is significantly more than any other team in Spain’s top division, with second-placed Valencia paying 38%.</p>
<p>Gimenez also confirmed that the club is currently facing a deficit of €27 million (£24 million&#x2F;$30 million), which he said was due to the high tax rates on winnings. He added that this was a major issue for Spanish clubs and called on the government to reduce the rate.</p>
<p>Betis are not the only La Liga side to be affected by the high tax rates. Other teams such as Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid also face difficulties in competing financially with teams from other European leagues.</p>
<p>Interestingly, clubs in England’s Premier League do not pay any tax on gambling winnings, while those in Germany’s Bundesliga pay just 14%. This gives English and German clubs a significant financial advantage over their Spanish counterparts.</p>
<h1 id="Betis-pays-more-tax-on-gambling-winnings-than-any-other-La-Liga-club"><a href="#Betis-pays-more-tax-on-gambling-winnings-than-any-other-La-Liga-club" class="headerlink" title="Betis pays more tax on gambling winnings than any other La Liga club"></a>Betis pays more tax on gambling winnings than any other La Liga club</h1><p>Income from gambling is taxable in Spain, and Betis has revealed that it paid more tax on its winnings from bets last year than any other La Liga club. According to documents released by the Spanish club, it paid €1.4 million ($1.6 million) in taxes on its gambling income for the 2017-18 season.</p>
<p>This was more than any other team in La Liga, with Barcelona coming in second with €1.2 million in gambling taxes paid. Interestingly, Real Madrid – who are notorious for their high spending – actually had one of the lowest payments, with just €360,000 being handed over to the taxman.</p>
<p>The news will likely come as a surprise to some observers, given that Madrid are often seen as the team with the most financial clout in Spanish football. It is also interesting to note that Atlético Madrid – who are usually considered second best to Barcelona – only had to pay €662,000 in gambling taxes last season.</p>
<p>Betis’s high payment is likely down to the fact that they had a good season last year and reached the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey. This resulted in them winning a lot of money from bets placed on their matches, and they were forced to pay a significant amount of tax on this income.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there has been a move by Spanish clubs in recent years to try and reduce their gambling tax payments. In 2016-17, La Liga clubs collectively paid €3 million less in gambling taxes than they did the previous season. This may be due to clubs becoming more savvy when it comes to placing bets, or simply because they are making less money overall due to reduced broadcast rights payments from TV companies.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it is clear that Spanish clubs are still having to pay a significant amount of tax on their gambling income. And with Betis at the top of the list for payments last season, it is clear that they are feeling the brunt of this more than anyone else.</p>
<h1 id="Real-Betis-to-pay-more-than-€1-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Real-Betis-to-pay-more-than-€1-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Real Betis to pay more than €1 million in taxes on gambling winnings"></a>Real Betis to pay more than €1 million in taxes on gambling winnings</h1><p>LaLiga side Real Betis have revealed that they will pay more than €1 million in taxes on their gambling winnings for the 2017&#x2F;18 season.</p>
<p>The Verdiblancos won a reported €4.5 million from their bets last year, and will have to hand over around 28% of that total to the Spanish government.</p>
<p>That will amount to a tax bill of €1.25 million, with Betis confirming that they have already paid the money over.</p>
<p>It is understood that the club placed bets on both LaLiga and international matches, with their biggest win coming on an FC Barcelona game where they made a profit of €370,000.</p>
<p>Real Madrid are also believed to have profited considerably from their gambling activities in recent years, with reports suggesting that they earned close to €10 million in profits in 2016&#x2F;17.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-winnings-tax-in-Real-Betis-higher-than-anywhere-else-in-Europe"><a href="#Gambling-winnings-tax-in-Real-Betis-higher-than-anywhere-else-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Gambling winnings tax in Real Betis higher than anywhere else in Europe"></a>Gambling winnings tax in Real Betis higher than anywhere else in Europe</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Spain’s Gambling Tax Rate is Among the Highest in Europe</p>
<p>In Spain, gambling winnings are subject to a tax rate of 47 percent, among the highest rates in Europe. This includes winnings from lotteries, casino games, bingo, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The Competitiveness of Spanish Gambling Tax Rates</p>
<p>In order to attract companies to operate within its borders, Spain has instituted a relatively low tax rate on corporate income. However, this low rate does not extend to gambling profits, which are taxed at a much higher rate. This has led to criticism from the gaming industry, which argues that the high tax rate harms Spain’s competitiveness in relation to other European countries.</p>
<p>Comparative Tax Rates for Gambling Winnings in Europe</p>
<p>Gambling winnings are generally subject to a tax rate of around 25 percent in most European countries. France has the highest tax rate at 45 percent, while Malta has the lowest at 0 percent. In addition, several European countries offer tax exemptions on gambling winnings. For example, Belgium exempts profits up to €100 euros (around $115) per week. Portugal exempts all gambling profits.</p>
